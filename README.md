# hangman-game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to deduce a hidden word one letter at a time. This project is an implementation of the game in Python.

## How to Play

1. A random word is selected and displayed on the screen with each letter replaced by an underscore (_).
2. Players guess letters one by one.
3. Each correct guess reveals the positions of the guessed letter in the word.
4. Each incorrect guess results in the loss of one life.
5. The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or loses all lives, resulting in the Hangman's demise.
